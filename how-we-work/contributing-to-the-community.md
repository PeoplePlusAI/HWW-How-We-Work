# 🖐 Contributing to the Community

We believe technology, especially ai, will cause paradigm shifts that can help India & its people reach their potential. We are organised as an ecology of working-groups and fuelled by purpose driven volunteer energy.

{% hint style="info" %}
* You don't need to formally join a working-group to contribute to it.
* Contributing to a working-group doesn't imply that you're obliged to commit to continued work or to joining on its meetings.
* You can continue to gift your energy to as many working-groups as you'd like in this light-touch, low commitment manner.
* Your contribution not matter how big or small will be acknowledged and logged on GitHub.
{% endhint %}

## Gift time and energy

* Working-groups live and work on **GitHub.**
* Each working-group maintains a **charter** that articulates their **shared vision.** This is a great starting point to get to know a group.
* Reading and participating in a group's **open discussions** will help you get a flavour of what's occupying the group currently.
* Each working-group maintains a **help needed** file in its repository. Simply take-up and deliver on any of the open-tasks.&#x20;
