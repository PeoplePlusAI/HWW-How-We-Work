  People+ai is organised as an ecology of multiple working-groups. A
  gardener-group integrates and weaves these multiple-working groups into a
  thriving ecosystem.

# ðŸŒ€ How we are organised

## Working Groups

Working groups are self-organising groups of volunteers contributing towards a specific used case/ public good/ project geared towards a +ai future. Each group is empowered to go chase their goals and is expected to periodically share insights, goals & progress with the people+ai community.

* **Shared Dream:** Each group defines itâ€™s vision and goals. A group may have multiple projects/ experiments it is undertaking towards the goal.
* **Membership:** Volunteers from multiple organisations/ backgrounds/ expertise contribute to a groups goal. The formal members have committed consistent time and energy towards the group's goal.
* **Contributing:** Anyone (not just the formal members) can contribute by responding to a groups calls for help. The membership of a group can be floating. To tap into talent and energy, we try to make it easy for people to contribute AND easy for people to hand-over and leave.

## Gardener-group

The gardener-group is a small team of full-time employees of People+ai. There are three key ecosystem functions that this group performs:

* **Pollinators:** Celebrate heroes and wins, bring visibility to working groups, attract partners and volunteers
* **Mycelium:** Enrich the soil by effectively articulating a [vision for the country.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Mi9QwJlsfb7xuxTBc0J/s/LYxrjqJDg0sJzSucIHRS/) Channelise resources and build partnerships across the network.
* **Janitorial:** We want volunteers to spend minimal time and energy on management overheads. We equip working-groups with tools, SOPs and guides to make starting and running a working-group extremely smooth and easy.

## Hosted at EkStep

* People+ai is hosted in [EkStep Foundation](https://ekstep.org/). A core group of early believers in the EkStep network felt the need for an organisation like People+ai and decided to resource and birth people+ai.&#x20;
* While EkStep is focussed on transforming the education sector, People+ai's focus in broader. This is why people+ai is building a distinct identity and brand.
* Administratively, being hosted at EkStep allowed People+ai to quickly start-off without being bogged down by paperwork associated with registering/ starting a new organisation.
* All expenses and related to People+ai are made through EkStepâ€™s accounts, all contracting for people+ai is done via EkStep.
