# ðŸ‘Š {Guide} Join a \[P+AI] Working Group

## Get to Know the Working Group

{% hint style="info" %}
Working Groups maintain a charter in their GitHub repository and publish periodically. These are the best places to discover the dream and journey a group has been on.
{% endhint %}

* **Read the Groups Charter.** This is the best point of entry into the groups collective dream, ongoing experiments and key next commitments.
* Explore the discussions on the group's GitHub repository. Catch-up on **open discussions** to get a feel of what's up in the group.
* Each group also has a **timeline** file that logs the weekly journey of the group.

## Time and Energy Commitment

{% hint style="info" %}
If you too share the groups dream and are excited to contribute, evaluate how you'd like to engage based on the time and energy you can put into this. Ir-respective of how you choose to engage, contributions no matter how small or large will be acknowledge.
{% endhint %}

### Volunteer from the Outside

{% hint style="info" %}
This doesn't involve an ongoing commitment of either time or energy. Help out as and when you can. We try our best to make it easy for people to contribute.
{% endhint %}

* Contribute to the **open discussions** in the groups git repo.
* Pick-up any of items from the group's **Help Needed** file and start delivering on them.
* Share the groups' thinking and calls for help with your wider network.

### Volunteer by formally joining the Group

{% hint style="info" %}
For those who driven by the dream and are willing to put in sustained time and energy to volunteer with the group.
{% endhint %}

1. Hopefully, you've spent some time volunteering from the outside. This will help you familiarise yourself with the group and build your presence in the group before formally joining.
2. Read the 'Help\_Needed' file in the Group's GitHub repository. Different groups may have different procedures for joining. Groups usually ask for a short intro, your motivations to join the group and how you feel you can contribute.
3. The bare minimum expectation is that you can attend almost all meetings of the working group. Frequency of meetings can range from fortnightly to bi-weekly and is decided by the group.
