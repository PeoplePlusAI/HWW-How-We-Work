## Why introduce your Org to People+ai?

### Shape the evolution of ai in your domain

People+ai is a community of doers and dreamers committed to shaping ai for societal good. Being a part of the community gives your org a chance to shape the direction in which ai evolves in your domain. For example, if you're org works in education, your org has the chance to influence the understanding, priorities and cutting edge experiments related to ai in education.

### Find collaborators to experiment on big bet projects

At people+ai, we pick and nurture critical big bets that we feel are necessary to direct the evolution  of ai in a manner that is rooted in the indian context and responds to our needs and concerns. This could range from fundamental research or infra like building India's own LLM or even putting out public goods and building DPIs. If your org feels that there is a big bet that needs to be taken, the people+ai community is the ideal ecosystem to find collaborators, resources and direction to make this a reality.

### Get inspired by other projects in the ecosystem

ai as a technology is both new and evoloving rapidly. In such a scenario, being able to unlock our imagination of the possibiltiies that ai can unleash in various domains is a challenge. The people+ai community is an ideal space to discover how multiple passionate people are thinking about ai and get exposure to various experiments and pilots being undertaken.
