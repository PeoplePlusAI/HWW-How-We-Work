## Volunteers

1. **How do I get started?** Go to peopleplus.ai/volunteer and fill out the volunteer form. You will receive a welcome email with information about People+ai, our Project Board, and an invitation to join a working group by scheduling a call with our community manager.
2. **Why should I volunteer with People+ai?** Everybody wants to be a part of something meaningful and bigger than themselves. People+ai is a volunteer-driven organisation that is building last-mile AI-powered solutions which can reach population scale in India. We have technologists, researchers, and business and social leaders who are collectively working together to be a part of the solution that makes a difference.
3. **How much time do I need to contribute?** Most volunteer engagements range between 3-5 hours per week and may become more if they take on the role of a project anchor.
4. **How do I discover projects?** You can look at the [Projects Board here](https://peopleplusai-crm.notion.site/People-ai-Projects-a1349fdc28704f979d463f3a35299a65).&#x20;
5. **Can I contribute to multiple projects at once?** - Yes, you can. You can find projects that align with your interests on the project board, and reach out to david@peopleplus.ai to formally join the group.&#x20;
6. **Can I contribute without joining a group?** You don't need to formally join a working-group to contribute to it. Our project files are listed on our Notion board with it's supporting GitHub repository. We encourage our community to participate and contribute to those channels with project guidance. The contribution principles are very much like open-source. You can continue to gift your energy to as many working-groups as you'd like in this light-touch manner.
7. **How will I track my contribution?** Your contribution no matter how big or small will be acknowledged and logged on GitHub. For outputs such as research papers, you would be marked as a contributor or co-author, etc. as is relevant. In some circumstances, People+ai can issue volunteer letters to people who are actively contributing.
8. **I have an AI Use Case idea that is not listed on the Project Board** - We always welcome new ideas. Please write to david@peopleplus.ai with information on your AI Use Case Idea. If this aligns with our work and mission, we can launch this as a new working group and invite you as the project anchor to spearhead this new initiative.
