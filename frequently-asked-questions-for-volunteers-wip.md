# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions for Volunteers \[WIP]

## Volunteers

1. **How much time can I contribute?** It completely depends on you. You will have to c
2. **How should I discover new projects?** You can look at the [Projects Board here](https://peopleplusai-crm.notion.site/People-ai-Projects-a1349fdc28704f979d463f3a35299a65).&#x20;
3. **Can I contribute to multiple projects at once?** - Yes you can. You don't need to formally join a working-group to contribute to it. The contribution principles are very much like open-source. Contributing to a working-group doesn't imply that you're obliged to commit to continued work or to joining on its meetings. You can continue to gift your energy to as many working-groups as you'd like in this light-touch, low commitment manner.
4. **How will I track my contribution?** Your contribution no matter how big or small will be acknowledged and logged on GitHub. For outputs such as research papers, you would be marked as a contributor or co-author, etc. as is relevant.
5. **Do you have time to take this on?** - While we want you to be enthusiastic about this opportunity, and while there may be some unknowns, we encourage you to be realistic about your availability and to communicate that clearly to the network. We are flexible, hence don’t have any formality to join the working in the group. If you want help in thinking about how to do this, pleach out to david@peopleplus.ai
6. **Can you treat this as a professional opportunity?** The opportunities and projects we've arranged tend to be high-impact opportunities that leverage professional skills and are focused on specific identified tasks. As such, you may be taking on more responsibility, be given more investment of staff time, exercise more independence, and be counted on more than a typical volunteer. Make sure that you can engage with the opportunity with professionalism in communication, and accountability.



**While you're ultimately responsible for getting your work done and your relationship with the org, we want you to succeed! The following support structures are available to you:**

* For general assistance and support from peers, try to reach other volunteers.
* For technical or domain-specific needs, try reaching out to project leads.
