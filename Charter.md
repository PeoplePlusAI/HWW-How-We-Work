# Collective Hope/ Dream
## Vision/ Dream: Fostering Open Collaboration for a +ai Future
- People+ai is a not-for-profit that believes technology, especially ai, will cause paradigm shifts that can help India & its people reach their potential.
- We are not doing this alone. There are many wonderful people in the country doing amazing things already. We partner with organisations of all kinds to figure out how ai can help serve the people.
- We are creating open spaces where partners and volunteers can discover needs, share resources and collaborate with each other.
- **Without having to go through us!**

## What We're Trying to Make Happen
- Make it very **easy and instantaneous** for someone ready to roll up their sleeves to **volunteer and contribute.**
- **Ambitious ai ideas** for the country are able to **find a home** in our network **quickly and easily.**
- **Time and energy** required for running & **managing working-groups** should be **minimal.**
- **Foster a culture** where partners and volunteers actively nurture ideas.
